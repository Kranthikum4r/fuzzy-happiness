   <b><br>Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. </br>
    The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life.<br>With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface.</br></b>
    <br><b>Size</b></br>
    Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 8,000 miles. 
    <b><br>Location</br></b>
    Earth is the third planet from the sun, with an average distance of about 93 million miles. 
    <b><br>Composition</br></b>
    Earth is made up of three layers: the crust, the mantle, and the core. The crust is made of solid rock, mostly basalt and granite. The mantle is made of rock containing silicon, iron, magnesium, aluminum, oxygen, and other minerals. 
    <b><br> Life</br></b>
    Earth is the only planet in our solar system known to support life. This is because Earth has liquid water on its surface and the right combination of air, water, and gases for life. 
    <b><br> Motion</br></b>
    Earth rotates on its axis in a clockwise motion, taking 23.9 hours to complete one rotation. This rotation causes day and night. Earth also revolves around the sun in an anticlockwise direction, taking 365 days, 6 hours, and 9 minutes to complete one revolution. This revolution causes the change in seasons. 
    <b><br>Danger</br></b>
    Earth is in danger due to overuse and wastage of resources, which is leading to global warming. This is affecting the survival conditions for human beings and all living things. 
    <b><br>Earth Day</br></b>
    Earth Day is celebrated on Axpril 22 to support and protect the environment. It is celebrated in various schools and colleges across the world
